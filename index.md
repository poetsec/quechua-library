### About
Quechua is a Native American language spoken in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and other South American countries. It can be hard to find resources for learning Quechua or resources written/spoken in the language, and this project aims to solve that problem by gathering links to as many available resources as possible on one website. It acts as a directory of books, video, audio, courses, and other resources with links to where each one can be found online.

### What Do I Need to Get Involved?
All you need to contribute to the project is some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. You can also contribute to the documentation here on GitHub or in any other way you would like to. Since much of the work needing to be done involves finding resources and adding them to the website (writing in resource titles and providing links to where they can be found online), this project is great for someone new to web development or just starting out with contributing to open source.
