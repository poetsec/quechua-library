## About
Quechua is a Native American language spoken in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and other South American countries. It can be hard to find resources for learning Quechua or resources written/spoken in the language, and this project aims to solve that problem by gathering links to as many available resources as possible on one website. It acts as a directory of books, video, audio, courses, and other resources with links to where each one can be found online.

## What Do I Need to Get Involved?
All you need to contribute to the project is some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. You can also contribute to the documentation here on GitHub or in any other way you would like to. Since much of the work needing to be done involves finding resources and adding them to the website (writing in resource titles and providing links to where they can be found online), this project is great for someone new to web development or just starting out with contributing to open source.

# Contributing

The idea is to make contributing to this project as easy as possible so that people of all skill levels can help out where and how they want to. A few things you can do to contribute are:

- Report an issue or bug
- Submit a fix
- Add to or update the documentation
- Translate the documentation and/or website into other languages
- Suggest new features
- Add content and/or styling to the website

## Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to add code and make other changes to the project.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make your changes and document them in your commit comment.
3. Submit your pull request

## Local Development

An easy way to see how your changes affect the website as you are coding on your local machine is to run the website files in a live server. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this, it can easily be done using the [live server extension on Visual Studio Code][liveserver]. Once your changes are complete you can push your changes to your branch of the project and submit your pull request.

## Reporting Issues or Bugs

GitHub's issues feature is used to report and track issues or bugs, or to request a new feature. You can open a new issue [here][here].

**When reporting a bug:**
- Be specific: explain what you expect to happen vs what actually happens.
- Provide a screenshot or video of the bug if possible
- Include notes (why you think the bug might be happening or things you may have tried to fix it but didn't work).

**When requesting a new feature:**
- Include a summary of your idea.
- Explain what you would like added and why.
- Add any additional context.
